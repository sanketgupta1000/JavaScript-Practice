In node, we can have modules, to increase modularity, combine code logically, and to increase code reusability.

A module is nothing but a file, which 'exports' something. And to be able to use the exported things, they must be imported in another file.

Types:
1. Core modules: Inbuilt modules, like file system(fs), http(for create our own server), etc.
2. Local modules: also called custom modules, created by us.
3. Third party modules: managed through npm.
